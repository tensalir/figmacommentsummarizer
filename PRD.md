# Figma Comment Summarizer Plugin PRD

This document outlines the requirements, technical approach, and implementation plan for a Figma plugin that automatically summarizes and categorizes comments in Figma design files. The plugin uses Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model for summarization and categorization. Notably, since Figma’s Personal Access Tokens do not grant read access to comments, the plugin will employ an OAuth 2.0–based authentication flow to access the Figma REST API (using the `GET /v1/files/:file_key/comments` endpoint).

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Design teams often struggle with the sheer volume of comments on Figma design files. Feedback can be scattered, contradictory, or overly verbose. This makes it difficult to quickly grasp key themes and address conflicting feedback (e.g., one comment suggests increasing font size while another advocates reducing it). Manually reviewing all comments is time-consuming and error-prone.

The goal is to build a Figma plugin that:
- Automatically fetches and summarizes comments.
- Categorizes feedback by topics (e.g., typography, color, layout).
- Detects and highlights contradictory comments.
- Presents these summaries in a clean, intuitive UI directly inside Figma.

---

## 2. Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goal:**  
Enable Figma users to quickly obtain a concise, categorized summary of design comments through a seamless plugin experience, thereby improving team communication and expediting design iterations.

**Objectives:**

- **Automatic Summaries:**  
  Generate brief, high-level summaries of all comments on a Figma file or within a selected frame.
  
- **Topic Categorization:**  
  Group comments into thematic clusters (e.g., typography, color, layout) and produce summaries for each cluster.
  
- **Contradiction Detection:**  
  Identify and clearly flag any contradictory feedback within each category.
  
- **User Experience:**  
  Integrate the summarization functionality behind a “Summarize” button that opens a pop-up window within Figma.
  
- **API Integration:**  
  Use Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet (version `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) to handle summarization and categorization.
  
- **OAuth Authentication:**  
  Implement an OAuth 2.0–based authentication flow with Figma to securely access comments via the Figma REST API.
  
- **Developer Efficiency:**  
  Leverage the Cursor development environment (and its associated `.cursorrules` file) to expedite coding and adhere to best practices shared via official documentation, Substack, Reddit, and X (formerly Twitter).

---

## 3. Technical Requirements

### Figma Plugin Platform

- **Environment:**  
  The plugin will be developed using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript (transpiled to JavaScript) in Figma’s plugin sandbox.
  
- **Comment Retrieval:**  
  - Since Figma’s Personal Access Tokens cannot read comments, the plugin must use the Figma REST API with OAuth 2.0 authentication.  
  - It will call the endpoint `GET /v1/files/:file_key/comments` using an OAuth token in the header (`Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`).
  - The file key is obtained from the Figma file’s context, or may be prompted for if necessary.
  
- **Data Processing:**  
  - Extract relevant comment text and metadata from the JSON response.
  - Handle scenarios such as no comments or pagination if necessary.

### Natural Language Processing & Clustering

- **Summarization:**  
  Use Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet API to generate summaries.
  
- **Clustering:**  
  Instruct the model (via a carefully designed prompt) to group comments into topics and to highlight any contradictions within those clusters.
  
- **Prompt Construction:**  
  A sample prompt might be:  
  > "You are an assistant that summarizes design feedback. Below are comments from a Figma file. Group them by topic and provide a brief summary for each group. If any comments contradict each other, note this explicitly. Here are the comments: [list of comments]. Please produce a structured summary in markdown."
  
- **Output Parsing:**  
  The plugin will parse the AI’s output (preferably returned in markdown or JSON format) and inject it into the UI.

### Performance & Error Handling

- **Loading Feedback:**  
  Display a spinner or progress message during comment retrieval and summarization.
  
- **Error Management:**  
  - If the API call fails (network error, token expiration, etc.), display user-friendly error messages.
  - Handle scenarios where no comments are available gracefully.

---

## 4. API Integration

### Anthropic Claude Integration

- **Model Selection:**  
  Use the model version `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` for consistent, high-quality summaries.
  
- **API Request:**  
  - Construct a request with the full set of comments and clear instructions on clustering and contradiction detection.
  - Set parameters like `max_tokens` and `temperature` to balance brevity and accuracy.
  
- **Output Handling:**  
  - Expect the output in a structured format (markdown or JSON) and parse accordingly.
  - Integrate the summarized text into the plugin’s pop-up UI.

### Figma OAuth Integration

Since a Personal Access Token cannot be used to read comments, the plugin must use OAuth 2.0:

- **OAuth Flow:**
  - **Initial Authorization:**  
    - When the user first launches the plugin, they are presented with a clear **“Authorize with Figma”** prompt.
    - Upon clicking the button, the plugin opens Figma’s OAuth URL in an external browser window. This URL includes parameters such as `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, requested scopes (to access comments), and a PKCE `code_challenge` for enhanced security.
  
  - **Authorization Code Exchange:**  
    - After the user logs in and consents, Figma issues an authorization code via a redirect.  
    - An external callback service or webpage (hosted securely over HTTPS) captures this code.
    - The plugin then exchanges the code for an **access token** (and, optionally, a refresh token) by making a secure call to Figma’s OAuth token endpoint.
  
  - **Token Storage:**  
    - Once received, the access token is stored in `figma.clientStorage` so that it persists across sessions.
    - If a refresh token is provided, it is stored securely alongside the access token.
  
  - **Token Refresh:**  
    - On subsequent plugin launches, the plugin checks for a stored access token.  
    - If the token is expired (or a 401 Unauthorized is encountered), the plugin uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token silently.
    - If refreshing fails, the plugin will prompt the user to re-authenticate.
  
  - **Communication:**  
    - The OAuth process involves communication between the plugin’s UI (which opens the external browser for OAuth) and the main code (which stores tokens). Secure messaging (using `postMessage`) or polling an external callback endpoint is used to transfer the token securely.

- **API Request Using OAuth:**  
  - All calls to Figma’s REST API (e.g., `GET /v1/files/:file_key/comments`) include the header `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`.
  - The OAuth token provides the necessary permissions to access file comments as per Figma’s API documentation.

---

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

### Plugin Activation & Main UI

- **Entry Point:**  
  The plugin is launched from Figma’s Plugins menu via an option such as **“Summarize Comments”**.
  
- **Main UI:**  
  - A pop-up modal opens within Figma containing the primary interface.
  - The modal includes a header (e.g., “Comment Summary”), and a content area where summaries are displayed.
  - A toggle or scope selector allows users to choose between summarizing comments for the entire file or just the currently selected frame.
  - A prominent **“Summarize”** button triggers the process.

### Login and Authorization UI

- **Initial Authentication:**  
  - If no valid OAuth token is found, the UI displays a login prompt with a clear call-to-action button such as **“Authorize with Figma”**.
  - Informational text explains why the authorization is needed and assures users that their credentials are not stored by the plugin.
  
- **Loading and Feedback States:**  
  - Once the user authorizes the plugin, a loading state (spinner or progress indicator) appears as the plugin fetches comments and calls the summarization API.
  - Upon completion, the summary is displayed in a scrollable, readable format.
  
- **Additional Options:**  
  - (Optional) A “Copy Summary” button to copy the summarized text to the clipboard.
  - A “Log Out” or “Re-authenticate” option in the settings to allow users to disconnect their account if needed.

---

## 6. Authentication & Security

### OAuth-Based Authentication

- **Authorization Flow:**
  1. **User Prompt:** On first use (or if no valid token exists), the plugin shows a login screen asking the user to authenticate via Figma.
  2. **External OAuth Window:** Clicking “Authorize with Figma” opens Figma’s OAuth URL (with proper parameters like `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, and PKCE `code_challenge`) in the user’s browser.
  3. **Authorization Code Capture:**  
     - Figma issues an authorization code after the user consents.
     - An external, secure callback service captures this code.
  4. **Token Exchange:**  
     - The plugin exchanges the authorization code for an access token (and refresh token) by calling Figma’s OAuth token endpoint.
  5. **Token Storage:**  
     - The access token is stored securely using `figma.clientStorage` for reuse.
     - The refresh token is also stored (if provided) and used to silently refresh the access token when needed.
  
- **Token Refresh & Expiration:**  
  - The plugin monitors the token’s expiry (if provided by Figma) or detects a 401 Unauthorized response.
  - On token expiration, it automatically attempts to refresh the token using the stored refresh token.
  - If the refresh fails or the refresh token is not available, the plugin prompts the user to re-authenticate.

### Security Best Practices

- **PKCE Flow:**  
  Utilize the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension to avoid the need for a client secret, ensuring that even if the authorization code is intercepted, it cannot be exchanged without the correct verifier.
  
- **Scoped Access:**  
  Request only the minimal OAuth scopes necessary to read comments from the file. This principle of least privilege minimizes risk.
  
- **Secure Storage:**  
  Store both access and refresh tokens in `figma.clientStorage`, which is private to the plugin. No sensitive tokens are logged or exposed in the UI.
  
- **Data Privacy:**  
  Inform users that their comments (text data) will be sent to Anthropic’s API for summarization. Ensure that only necessary data is transmitted.
  
- **External Callback Security:**  
  The external service used to capture the authorization code must use HTTPS and delete any temporary data immediately after the token exchange.

## 7. Development Environment Setup (Figma Plugin & Cursor)

### Figma Plugin Setup

- **Project Scaffolding:**  
  - Create a `manifest.json` file with the plugin name, API version, main code file, and UI HTML file.
  - Set up a TypeScript project with a bundler (e.g., Webpack or Parcel) configured to produce files compatible with Figma’s sandbox.
  
- **Local Testing:**  
  - Use Figma’s “Import plugin from manifest” feature to load and test the plugin.
  - Utilize Figma’s plugin debugger for logging and troubleshooting.

### Using Cursor for Development

- **Cursor Integration:**  
  - Open the project in the Cursor code editor, which leverages AI-assisted coding.
  - Create a `.cursorrules` file (in JSON format) that provides project-specific instructions, coding style, and context (e.g., details about Figma plugin APIs, OAuth flow, etc.).
  
- **Documentation and Version Control:**  
  - Integrate relevant documentation (Figma API docs, Anthropic API docs, OAuth guidelines) into the Cursor context.
  - Use git for version control and commit changes frequently to track progress.

## 8. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup

1. **Finalize Requirements:**  
   - Review this PRD with stakeholders to ensure all needs are met.
  
2. **Development Environment:**  
   - Scaffold the project with a `manifest.json`, TypeScript configuration, and bundler setup.
   - Configure OAuth credentials by registering the plugin as an OAuth app in Figma (obtaining a `client_id` and setting the proper `redirect_uri`).
   - Set up the development environment in Cursor with a `.cursorrules` file.

3. **API Access Preparation:**  
   - Set up an external callback service/page for handling the OAuth redirection and code exchange.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Development

4. **Implement OAuth Flow:**  
   - Develop the UI for the login prompt.
   - Initiate the OAuth process, including PKCE code generation and launching the external OAuth window.
   - Implement token exchange and secure storage using `figma.clientStorage`.
   - Add logic for token refresh and error handling (e.g., when a token expires).

5. **Comment Fetching Module:**  
   - Once authenticated, use the OAuth token to call Figma’s REST API (`GET /v1/files/:file_key/comments`).
   - Parse and store the fetched comment data for further processing.

6. **Claude API Integration:**  
   - Build a function to construct the summarization prompt from fetched comments.
   - Call Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet API with the prompt.
   - Parse the returned summary (structured as markdown or JSON) for display.

7. **UI Integration:**  
   - Build the pop-up UI that shows the summarization results.
   - Implement a scope selector (entire file vs. current frame) and a “Summarize” button.
   - Integrate error handling and loading states within the UI.

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement

8. **Internal Testing:**  
   - Test the OAuth flow, token storage, and refresh logic.
   - Use a sample Figma file with test comments to validate comment fetching.
   - Run end-to-end tests to ensure that summarization, clustering, and contradiction detection work as expected.

9. **Performance & UX Tuning:**  
   - Optimize prompt length and API parameters for performance.
   - Adjust UI elements based on user feedback, ensuring the login and summarization experiences are seamless.
   - Validate that errors (e.g., network issues, token expiry) are handled gracefully.

10. **Security Review:**  
    - Ensure tokens are stored securely and that no sensitive data is exposed.
    - Verify that the OAuth and token refresh mechanisms adhere to best practices.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring

11. **Documentation & Handoff:**  
    - Prepare a README with usage instructions, troubleshooting guidelines, and an overview of the OAuth process.
    - Train internal users on how to install and use the plugin.
  
12. **Deployment:**  
    - Package the plugin for internal distribution or Figma Community submission (if applicable).
  
13. **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  
    - Monitor usage, token refresh events, and API rate limits.
    - Gather user feedback and iterate on the plugin for improvements or additional features.
